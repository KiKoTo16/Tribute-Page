    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Rodrigo Duterte's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1945</strong> - Born in Maasin, Philippines</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1968</strong> -Duterte earned a political science degree (1968) from Lyceum of the Philippines University in Manila and a law degree (1972) from San Beda College.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1977</strong> - he joined the Davao City prosecutor’s office, where he remained until he was appointed (1986) vice mayor of that city.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1988</strong> -Duterte was elected mayor in 1988, and he was reelected to that post twice over the subsequent decade. Because of term-limit restrictions, he was barred from seeking reelection in 1998, but he successfully ran for a seat representing Davao in the Philippines House of Representatives.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2001</strong> - Upon the completion of that term in 2001, he returned to Davao City and was once more elected mayor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2010</strong> - Because the term-limit restriction again came into force in 2010, he was elected vice mayor, and his daughter Sara served as mayor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2013</strong> -  In 2013 Duterte returned to the mayor’s office, this time with his son Paolo (“Pulong”) serving as vice mayor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2016</strong> -Duterte was inaugurated as president of the Philippines.In his first six months in office, more than 6,000 people were killed in Duterte’s “war on drugs.” A fraction of those deaths occurred during police operations. The overwhelming majority were extrajudicial killings by death squads. Metro Manila’s funeral parlours were strained beyond capacity, and hundreds of unidentified or unclaimed bodies were interred in mass burials. Human rights organizations and Roman Catholic officials spoke out against the bloodshed, but Duterte responded by accusing the church of corruption and the sexual abuse of children.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2017</strong> - Duterte met with Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin to discuss the prospect of an arms deal. While Duterte was in Moscow, a series of deadly clashes erupted in Marawi between Filipino troops and Islamist fighters linked to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL; also called ISIS). Duterte cut short his trip and declared a state of martial law covering the entire island of Mindanao.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2018</strong> - In February 2018 the International Criminal Court (ICC) opened a preliminary investigation into the more than 12,000 deaths that had occurred during Duterte’s “war on drugs.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2019</strong> - Duterte responded by announcing his intention to withdraw the Philippines from the ICC; that withdrawal became official in March 2019. International and domestic human rights organizations continued to remain sharply critical of Duterte, but he dismissed them, going so far as to instruct police to shoot activists if they were “obstructing justice.”

        "It is a neverending war...( When I came to power) I expected everybody was working well, i did not know when I arrived, when I got to look into the records of drug cases, then I realized that I was fighting against my own government, because of the police, the customs, and everyone else were dipping their dirty fingers into it."
